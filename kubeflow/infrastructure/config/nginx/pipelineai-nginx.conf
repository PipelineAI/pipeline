# The most CPU-intensive operation is the SSL handshake
# There are two ways to minimize the number of these operations per client:
#   first is by enabling keepalive connections to send several requests via one connection
#   second is to reuse SSL session parameters to avoid SSL handshakes for parallel and subsequent connections
# The sessions are stored in an SSL session cache shared between workers and configured by the ssl_session_cache directive
# One megabyte of the cache contains about 4000 sessions
# The default cache timeout is 5 minutes which can be increased by using the ssl_session_timeout directive

    # location syntax - locations are defined by a prefix string, or by a regular expression
    #
    #   location prefixes
    #       =  : prefix string - exact match of URI and location
    #               Example: location = / { config A }
    #          : prefix string - no prefix simple string match root
    #               Example: location / { config B }
    #          : prefix string ending with "/" slash character special processing - no prefix simple string match with special processing
    #               Example: location /documents/ { config C }
    #       ^~ : prefix string - when the longest matching prefix location has “^~” regular expressions are not checked
    #               Example: location ^~ /images/ { config D }
    #       ~* : regular expression - case-insensitive
    #               Example: location ~* \.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ { config E }
    #       ~  : regular expression - case-sensitive
    #               Example: location ~* /Images/\.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ { config F }
    #       @  : named location prefix used for request redirection ( not used for regular request processing )
    #               Example: location @customproxy { config G }
    #
    #   location matching rules
    #       1) nginx checks locations defined as simple strings  ( no prefix )
    #           a) when an exact match "=" is found, the search terminates
    #           b) when the longest match has the “^~” modifier, the search terminates
    #       2) when neither a nor b the location with the longest matching prefix is selected and remembered
    #       3) regular expressions are checked, in the order of their appearance in the configuration below terminating on 1st match
    #       4) if no match with a regular expression is found then the configuration of the prefix location remembered in step 2) is used
    #
    #       Example location rule matches:
    #       config A : /
    #       config B : /index.html
    #       config C : /documents/document.html
    #       config D : /images/1.gif
    #       config E : /documents/1.jpg
    #       config F : /Images/1.gif
    #
    #   location special processing : prefix string ending with "/" slash character
    #       1) requests are processed by one of:
    #           proxy_pass, fastcgi_pass, uwsgi_pass, scgi_pass, memcached_pass, or grpc_pass
    #       2) special processing is performed
    #
    #       301 permanent redirect status code
    #           returned when URI matches this prefix string WITHOUT the trailing "/" slash
    #           to prevent 301 permanent redirect define both:
    #               1) URI exact match "=" location like:
    #                   location = /user {
    #                       proxy_pass http://login.example.com;
    #                   }
    #               2) prefix string ending with "/" slash character location
    #                   location /user/ {
    #                       proxy_pass http://user.example.com;
    #                   }
    #
    #   root
    #       Sets the root directory for requests. For example, with the following configuration
    #
    #       Syntax: root path;
    #       Default: root html;
    #       Context:    http, server, location, if in location
    #
    #       Example:
    #           location /i/ {
    #               root /data/w3;
    #           }
    #           The /data/w3/i/top.gif file will be sent in response to the “/i/top.gif” request.
    #
    #   error processing
    #       status code of the last occurred error is returned to the client
    #
    #       named location "@" redirection error processing

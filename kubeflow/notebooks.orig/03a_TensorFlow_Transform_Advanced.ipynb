    "# Preprocessing data with TensorFlow Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a somewhat more advanced example of how <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/'>TensorFlow Transform</a> (`tf.Transform`) can be used to preprocess data using exactly the same code for both training a model and serving inferences in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Transform is a library for preprocessing input data for TensorFlow, including creating features that require a full pass over the training dataset.  For example, using TensorFlow Transform you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normalize an input value by using the mean and standard deviation\n",
    "* Convert strings to integers by generating a vocabulary over all of the input values\n",
    "* Convert floats to integers by assigning them to buckets, based on the observed data distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow has built-in support for manipulations on a single example or a batch of examples. `tf.Transform` extends these capabilities to support full passes over the entire training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of `tf.Transform` is exported as a TensorFlow graph which you can use for both training and serving. Using the same graph for both training and serving can prevent skew, since the same transformations are applied in both stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Point: In order to understand `tf.Transform` and how it works with Apache Beam, you'll need to know a little bit about Apache Beam itself.  The <a target='_blank' href='https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/'>Beam Programming Guide</a> is a great place to start."

    "\n",
    "Key Point: As a modeler and developer, think about how this data is used and the potential benefits and harm a model's predictions can cause. A model like this could reinforce societal biases and disparities. Is a feature relevant to the problem you want to solve or will it introduce bias?

    "### Create a `tf.Transform` preprocessing_fn\n",
    "The _preprocessing function_ is the most important concept of tf.Transform. A preprocessing function is where the transformation of the dataset really happens. It accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors, where a tensor means a [`Tensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) or [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor). There are two main groups of API calls that typically form the heart of a preprocessing function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TensorFlow Ops:** Any function that accepts and returns tensors, which usually means TensorFlow ops. These add TensorFlow operations to the graph that transforms raw data into transformed data one feature vector at a time.  These will run for every example, during both training and serving.\n",
    "2. **TensorFlow Transform Analyzers:** Any of the analyzers provided by tf.Transform. Analyzers also accept and return tensors, but unlike TensorFlow ops they only run once, during training, and typically make a full pass over the entire training dataset. They create [tensor constants](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/constant), which are added to your graph. For example, `tft.min` computes the minimum of a tensor over the training dataset. tf.Transform provides a fixed set of analyzers, but this will be extended in future versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caution: When you apply your preprocessing function to serving inferences, the constants that were created by analyzers during training do not change.  If your data has trend or seasonality components, plan accordingly."

    "In this example we used `tf.Transform` to preprocess a dataset of census data, and train a model with the cleaned and transformed data.  We also created an input function that we could use when we deploy our trained model in a production environment to perform inference.  By using the same code for both training and inference we avoid any issues with data skew.  Along the way we learned about creating an Apache Beam transform to perform the transformation that we needed for cleaing the data, and wrapped our data in TensorFlow `FeatureColumns`.  This is just a small piece of what TensorFlow Transform can do!  We encourage you to dive into `tf.Transform` and discover what it can do for you."

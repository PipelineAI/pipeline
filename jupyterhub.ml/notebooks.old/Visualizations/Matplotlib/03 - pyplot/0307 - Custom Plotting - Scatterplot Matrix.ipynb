    "In the last lesson, you learned how to plot multiple graphs in a single figure using the `subplot` function. Given the handful of plotting functions we learned in the previous lessons and the newly learned subplotting ability we picked up in the last lesson, we have everything we need to put together a very powerful, and visually impressive, visualization called a scatterplot matrix. A [scatterplot matrix][1] is exactly what you'd think it is: a matrix of scatterplots. Where a scatterplot is useful for visualizing relationships between variables in our data, a scatterplot matrix allows us to to see the relationships between every pair of variables in our data. \n",

    "## The `scatterplot_matrix` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scatterplot_matrix` function in the cell below, offers a very simple interface. It takes a 2D matrix of data, and an optional keyword argument `target`, which is just a boolean that specifies whether or not the matrix contains a column for the target variable. If the target parameter is `True`, which is the default value, then our function assumes that the last column in the matrix is the target variable and it will use the classes in that variable to color code the data in the matrix, otherwise, everything will be displayed in a single color.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code on lines 16-34 should look pretty familiar to you by now. Lines 16-23, get the names of the features in our data if we used `namedtuples` to describe the data in our matrix. Line 27 gets the set of classes from our target variable, if there is one. Lines 30 and 31 create our color map dictionary. And, finally, line 34 creates the `Figure` object that we'll draw our scatterplot matrix in---it does so to specify a somewhat larger size for the matrix than the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines 37-58 are where the real work is done. In this bit of code, we loop through each feature in our data set, and for each feature, we loop through every feature again. This allows us to pair every feature in our data set with one another. Then on line 40, we call the `subplot` function to create the subplot for the next pair of features, and the code on lines 43-50 draw the current scatterplot. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the diagonal, we have a case where you would be plotting one feature against itself. Since this doesn't yield any useful information, we have two choices, we can either leave that cell blank, or we could do something with it. On lines 53-58 you can see that we've chosen to display a histogram for the current feature in that cell. This allows us to see the distribution of our data set for that feature and doesn't waste a single bit of space in our matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the rest of the code just cleans up each of the plots a bit, e.g., turning off x and y axis labels on the inner graphs, to make the entire visualization easier to read."

In all honesty, it's better to use a library like [Seaborn][1], for instance, to create complex visualizations like the scatterplot matrix. But, rather, it's important to see just how easy it is to put something like our matrix function together using the relatively basic, but powerful, building blocks that matplotlib provides. Hopefully, this lesson will serve as some inspiration to you whenever you run into a need for a visualization that's not available right out of the box.\n",

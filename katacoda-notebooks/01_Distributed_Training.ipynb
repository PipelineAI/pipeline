The auth|ors propose two novel methodologies to accomplish this, namely, `model parallelism` and `data parallelism`.\n",

    "# Distributed Training in Tensorflow \n",
    "\"Data Parallelism\" is the most common training configuration, it involves multiple tasks in a `worker` job training the same model on different mini-batches of data, updating shared parameters hosted in one or more tasks in a `ps` (parameter server) job. All tasks typically run on different machines or containers. There are many ways to specify this structure in TensorFlow, and Tensorflow team are building libraries that will simplify the work of specifying a replicated model. Other platforms like `MXnet`, `Petuum` also have the same abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __In-graph replication__. In this approach, the client builds a single tf.Graph that contains one set of parameters (in tf.Variable nodes pinned to /job:ps); and multiple copies of the compute-intensive part of the model, each pinned to a different task in /job:worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Between-graph replication__. In this approach, there is a separate client for each /job:worker task, typically in the same process as the worker task. Each client builds a similar graph containing the parameters (pinned to /job:ps as before using tf.train.replica_device_setter to map them deterministically to the same tasks); and a single copy of the compute-intensive part of the model, pinned to the local task in /job:worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Asynchronous training__. In this approach, each replica of the graph has an independent training loop that executes without coordination. It is compatible with both forms of replication above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Synchronous training__. In this approach, all of the replicas read the same values for the current parameters, compute gradients in parallel, and then apply them together. It is compatible with in-graph replication (e.g. using gradient averaging as in the CIFAR-10 multi-GPU trainer), and between-graph replication (e.g. using the tf.train.SyncReplicasOptimizer).\n"

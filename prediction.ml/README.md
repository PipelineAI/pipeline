Application-specific source code, notebooks, libraries, and models have been moved to this [repo](https://github.com/fluxcapacitor/source.ml).

These repos are stitched together at deployment time using Kubernetes Volumes - similar to Docker Volumes.

See the [PipelineAI APIs](http://pipeline.io/api/) documentation for information on 
deploying models and using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

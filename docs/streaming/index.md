## Continuous, Streaming Model Predictions
PipelineIO's modular design lets you re-use your REST-based models inside your streams for continuous model predictions.

## Continuous, Incremental Model Training
PipelineIO supports continuous, incremental model training.  This is best described by Scikit-learn's [partial_fit()](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/scaling_strategies.html#incremental-learning) functionality.

The data consists of about 100 million movie ratings, and the goal is to predict missing entries in the movie-user rating matrix.\n\n| Field | Value |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Data Set Characteristics: | Multivariate, Time-Series |\n| Attribute Characteristics: | Integer |\n| Associated Tasks: | Clustering, Recommender-Systems |\n| Number of Instances: | 100480507 |\n| Number of Attributes: | 17770 |\n| Missing Values? | Yes |\n| Area: | N/A |\n| Date Donated | 2009-09-21 |\n\n\nSource:\nThe Netflix Prize \nhttp://www.netflixprize.com \n\n\nData Set Information:\n\nThis dataset was constructed to support participants in the Netflix Prize. \n\nThere are over 480,000 customers in the dataset, each identified by a unique integer id. \n\nThe title and release year for each movie is also provided. There are over 17,000 movies in the dataset, each identified by a unique integer id. \n\nThe dataset contains over 100 million ratings. The ratings were collected between October 1998 and December 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period.
